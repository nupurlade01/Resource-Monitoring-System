Quantum-AI Resource Monitor

A futuristic System Monitoring Dashboard built using JavaFX + Native C (JNI) that provides real-time insights into system performance with AI-powered analytics and threat detection.

Features

Real-Time Monitoring

CPU usage tracking
Memory (RAM) utilization
Disk I/O (Read/Write speeds)
Process monitoring with live updates
Native System Integration

Uses JNI (Java Native Interface) to interact with low-level system APIs
Retrieves real-time system data using Windows APIs
Example: Memory, process list, disk performance :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
Advanced UI (JavaFX)

Glassmorphism + futuristic UI design :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
Interactive charts (AreaChart, LineChart)
Process table with dynamic filtering
Smooth animations and neon-themed dashboard
Process Management

View all running processes
Kill processes directly from UI
Safe list protection for critical processes
AI Assistant

Built-in chatbot for system insights
Commands like:
Threat Matrix System

RAM & CPU threshold monitoring
Danger Zone visualization
Safe list management
Autonomous "Sentry Mode" for protection
Disk Monitoring

Real-time read/write speeds
Session tracking
Peak and average analytics
Tech Stack

Frontend: JavaFX
Backend: Java
System Layer: C (JNI)
APIs: Windows System APIs
Styling: CSS (Glassmorphism UI)

How It Works

JavaFX UI Layer
Displays charts, tables, and controls
Java Backend
Handles logic, process management, and AI assistant
JNI Layer
Connects Java with native C code
Native C Layer
Fetches low-level system data (memory, disk, processes)
Key Functionalities

Real-time process scanning
Disk performance monitoring
System analytics and prediction
Process termination (Kill Switch)
AI-based system assistant
Known Issues

JavaFX setup required (module path configuration)
Native library (monitor.dll) must be correctly loaded
Some metrics use fallback simulation if native calls fail
Future Enhancements

Cross-platform support (Linux/Mac)
Real GPU monitoring
Cloud-based analytics
Mobile dashboard integration
